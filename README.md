# Wang-Landau Algorithm for the 3D Ising gauge Model

This project implements the Wang-Landau algorithm to compute the density of states and derive thermodynamic quantities of the 3D Ising gauge model (e.g. average energy, specific heat) for various lattice sizes.

## Description

The Wang-Landau algorithm is a relatively recent Monte Carlo method more efficent than the previous ones.
The idea of the Wang-Landau algorithm is to directly estimates the density of states g(E) of a system by performing a random walk in energy space.
Thus, the partition function Z can be written as Z = ∑<sub>E</sub> g(E)exp(-βE). The main advantage il that g(E) does not depend on the temperature, we can construct canonical 
distributions at any temperature if we can estimate g(E) with high accuracy for all energies. 


This simulation performs the following steps:

1. Initialize a 2D lattice of spins with random configuration.
2. Perform the Wang-Landau algorithm to estimate the density of states.
3. Compute average energy <E>, energy variance <E^2> - < E >^2, and specific heat for a range of temperatures from 0.5 to 4.1.
4. Repeat simulations for different lattice sizes and save the data.

## Wang-Langau algorithm

The Wang-Landau algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the lattice with an arbitrary configuration with energy E1.
2. In principle we don't know g(E), so the simplest approach is to set g(E)=1 for all the possible energies.
3. nitialize the histogram H(E)=0 for all possible energies, which records how frequently each energy level is visited.
4. Initialize the modificator factor f, we suggest f=exp(1).
5. Pick a spin randomly and change its state, now the energy of the system is E2.
6. The new state it's accepted is p(E1->E2) = min(g(E1)/g(E2) ; 1).
7. If the new state with energy E2 is accepted, we multiply g(E2)->g(E2)xf and H(E2)->H(E2)+1.
8. If the new state with energy E2 is not accepted, we multiply g(E1)->g(E1)xf and H(E1)->H(E1)+1.
9. We proceed with the random walk in energy space until we obtain a "flat" histogram H(E), then we reduce the modificator factor. We suggest f->√f .
10. The steps 5-9 are repeated until f<f<sub>Threshold</sub>.

Because g(E) becomes very large, in practice it is preferable to work with the logarithm of the density of states, so that all possible ln g(E) will fit into double precision numbers.
## Structure

- `Spins`: Class representing a spin with its position and value (+1 or -1).
- `Wang_Landau`: Main function implementing the Wang-Landau sampling.
- `compute_total_energy`: Computes the total energy of the system.
- `mean_energy_from_log_g`: Computes <E> from log(g(E)).
- `mean_energy2_from_log_g`: Computes <E^2> from log(g(E)).
- Visualization of specific heat and average energy vs. temperature.

## Output

Two plots are generated for each set of simulations:

- Specific Heat per Spin vs Temperature
- Average Energy per Spin vs Temperature

Additionally, two text files are created for post-processing:

- `specific_heat_data.txt`: Contains specific heat data.
- `Variance_energy_data.txt`: Contains energy variance data.

Each file includes entries for different lattice sizes (e.g., 8×8, 14×14, 20×20).
